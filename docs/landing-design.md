# Design intent
- Feel: confident, product-led, minimal chrome; keep strong grid and roomy spacing.
- Typography: geometric sans (Space Grotesk/Manrope); use a single family to keep hierarchy clean; weight changes instead of size jumps.
- Color: deep midnight gradient background with bright teal + amber accents; neutral cards to keep focus on CTAs.
- Motion: subtle translate/opacity on section entry; limit to <200ms ease for hover.

# Structure
1. Hero with single CTA, supporting bullet trio, and product stats.
2. Rows: capability highlights, process/timeline, customer logos, testimonial, secondary CTA.
3. Footer with compact nav and social placeholders.

# Content cues
- Primary CTA: "Launch in 5 minutes"; secondary: "See it live".
- Copy tone: short, declarative, emphasizes orchestration/automation benefits.
- Illustrations: rely on gradients, glassmorphism panels, and icon circles instead of external assets.
