## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Replace the long Backlog block in AGENTS.MD with a two-line Backlog note under Agent Protocol (below PRs, above No ./runner). Line 1 states what Backlog is; line 2 states how to create a good task (read AGENTS.MD, skim CHANGELOG.md, search existing Backlog tasks, and write ≥3 hyper-specific AC).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 AGENTS.MD no longer contains the "BACKLOG WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS" block or its surrounding markers.
- [x] #2 AGENTS.MD Agent Protocol section includes two Backlog lines placed below PRs and above the No ./runner rule.

- [x] #3 Line 1 is "Backlog: mandatory repo task tracker for all work." and line 2 says: read `AGENTS.md`, skim `CHANGELOG.md`, search Backlog tasks, include skills/scripts use if needed, describe the task in prescriptive language within 2 long paragraphs, mention how to test, and write 3 hyper-specific acceptance criteria.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
- Remove the entire Backlog instructions block in AGENTS.MD.
- Add two Backlog lines under Agent Protocol, placed below PRs and above the No ./runner rule.
- Use the agreed short wording; verify placement and remove the old block; check AC.
