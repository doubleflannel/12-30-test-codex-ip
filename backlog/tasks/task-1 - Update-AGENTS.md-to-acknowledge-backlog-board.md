## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Add a brief note in AGENTS.md that mentions the Backlog board command and that it requires at least one task to display.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 AGENTS.MD includes the line: "Use Backlog for non-trivial work; read `backlog://workflow/overview` before creating tasks."
- [x] #2 AGENTS.MD no longer contains the backlog board note added previously.

- [x] #3 New guidance appears within the existing Backlog instructions block.
<!-- AC:END -->

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
- Replace the added board note with a single short guidance line about using Backlog for non-trivial work and reading the overview before creating tasks.
- Ensure the old board note is removed and guidance lives in the existing Backlog instructions block.
- Verify the new line exists and matches agreed wording; update acceptance criteria.
